                Hi, I’m a 9th-grade high school student who, like many others, found the AP course selection process
                confusing and overwhelming. In my attempt to navigate the information and make the best choices, I
                developed this tool to help guide my own decisions. As I worked on it, I realized that others might
                benefit from it too, so I decided to open it to the public.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a personal project of mine, and while I’ve done my best to provide helpful information, this
                tool should not be taken as the sole source for selecting AP courses or making academic decisions. The
                data used here is gathered from publicly available sources provided by the College Board, and I
                recommend cross-checking any information with the official College Board website or consulting with your
                school or academic advisors.
